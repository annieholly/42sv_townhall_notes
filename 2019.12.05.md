## Questions
**For those who had bought lunch with Gaetan using their wallet points, can we still have lunch with them?**

Yes, but you have 1 week to do so.

**For CYD, could you clarify on the tiers?**

There are 5 tiers that may happen at the end of the CYD. It's still in the making, but here are a few tiers:
* Pass: Good Job!
* Warning: Passed but concerned
* Meeting: Meet with bocal to get on track academically
* Eviction: Goodbye
The reason why that it is broken up this way is that it is understandable to get a little bit behind if there is something that happened in life. If you sleep through 1 test, we are not kicking you out of your home. If you fail CYD, you will receive an email with the next steps. We are working with everyone to be clear about CYD. Crystal, from Bocal, is in charge of this

**In terms of Gaetan, are you planning on doing something as great or even greater than 42?**

Yes. I have hope for the world and think that we could do more. Right now, I want to "sleep and rest."
> "I want to become spoiled and become a surfer for 1 month to enjoy the life"
> "I will do something...or join a big company and sell my soul"

**Someone had mentioned on Slack that Bocal will soon be regulating a system to check for regular commits. Could you clarify on this?"**

Students will be grandfathered in. There will be a period of time in which students' work will be checked for commits. The reason for this is because commiting is a good practice, and its a way to track to see if students are actually working. There have been students who have multiple projects open but they are not working on it. These projects will be closed if there are no commits.

**Is 42 accelerate still happening?**

Beginning of next year. Speak to Jim Zheng if you have any questions. There will be an event regarding 42 Accelerate in the future.

**Is wifi in the dorm?**

It should be back up. There was a minor small power outage today, but it is unsure what caused the power outage. Wifi technically is working in the dorms, but it is only consistent on the first floor. Wifi is intermittent on the 2nd and 3rd floor but we are aware of this issue. 

**Is there is any information regarding FileMaker?**

The next one is spring but there are no set dates right now.

**In terms of the new curriculum, is there a plan in the next couple to rollover to that?**

At the time, nope. However, in the next few months, possibly. We currently do not have the infrastructure to set that up.

**What about the new norm? The define feature**

It was used to prevent people from macro-ing the code to pass norminette (bad coding habit).

**Are you going to do anything about the days in which hours were gone? The internet/power outage issue**

For this last outage when the internet was down, bocal is crediting 6 hours for each day the internet was down (2 days). A couple weeks ago, bocal took the hour requirement down from 35 to 25 during that week. If hours are not logging for a few hours, bocal will have a meeting to discuss how to allocate the appropriate hours or decrease the hours appropriately.
